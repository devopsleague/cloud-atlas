Are you SURE you wish for rvm to implode?
This will recursively remove /home/admin/.rvm and other rvm traces?
(anything other than 'yes' will cancel) > yes
Removing rvm-shipped binaries (rvm-prompt, rvm, rvm-sudo rvm-shell and rvm-auto-ruby)
Removing rvm wrappers in /home/admin/.rvm/bin
Hai! Removing /home/admin/.rvm
/home/admin/.rvm has been removed.

Note you may need to manually remove /etc/rvmrc and ~/.rvmrc if they exist still.
Please check all .bashrc .bash_profile .profile and .zshrc for RVM source lines and delete or comment out if this was a Per-User installation.
Also make sure to remove `rvm` group if this was a system installation.
Finally it might help to relogin / restart if you want to have fresh environment (like for installing RVM again).
