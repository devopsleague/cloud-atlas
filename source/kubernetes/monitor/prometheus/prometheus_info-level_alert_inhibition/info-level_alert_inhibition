[NONE] Info-level alert inhibition.
Description: This is an alert that is used to inhibit info alerts.
By themselves, the info-level alerts are sometimes very noisy, but they are relevant when combined with
other alerts.
This alert fires whenever there's a severity="info" alert, and stops firing when another alert with a
severity of 'warning' or 'critical' starts firing on the same namespace.
This alert should be routed to a null receiver and configured to inhibit alerts with severity="info".
