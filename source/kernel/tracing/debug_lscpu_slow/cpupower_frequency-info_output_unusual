analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: acpi-cpufreq
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 2.00 GHz
  available frequency steps:  2.00 GHz, 1.60 GHz, 1.20 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 2.00 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: 2.00 GHz (asserted by call to hardware)
