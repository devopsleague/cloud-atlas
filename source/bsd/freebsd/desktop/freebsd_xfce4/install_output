The duktape-lib port currently does not have a maintainer. As a result, it is
more likely to have unresolved issues, not be up-to-date, or even be removed in
the future. To volunteer to maintain this port, please create an issue at:

If arrow keys don't work under X11 switch to legacy rules e.g.,

For sh/bash/ksh/zsh run and (optionally) add into ~/.profile:
  export XKB_DEFAULT_RULES=xorg

For csh/tcsh run and (optionally) add into ~/.login:
  setenv XKB_DEFAULT_RULES xorg

Message from libgtop-2.40.0_1:

--
In order to use the File System read/write monitor, you must chmod
/dev/devstat so that all users can open it read-only.  For example:

# chmod 0444 /dev/devstat

In order for this to persist across reboots, add the following to
/etc/devfs.conf:

perm	devstat	0444

Message from libsoup-2.74.3:

--
libsoup can use NTLM authentication if it is compiled
with the SMB option. To use it, you must install a
port that provides NTLM, like net/samba412 or net/samba413.

Message from cyrus-sasl-2.1.28_5:

--
You can use sasldb2 for authentication, to add users use:

	saslpasswd2 -c username

If you want to enable SMTP AUTH with the system Sendmail, read
Sendmail.README

NOTE: This port has been compiled with a default pwcheck_method of
      auxprop.  If you want to authenticate your user by /etc/passwd,
      PAM or LDAP, install ports/security/cyrus-sasl2-saslauthd and
      set sasl_pwcheck_method to saslauthd after installing the
      Cyrus-IMAPd 2.X port.  You should also check the
      /usr/local/lib/sasl2/*.conf files for the correct
      pwcheck_method.
      If you want to use GSSAPI mechanism, install
      ports/security/cyrus-sasl2-gssapi.
      If you want to use SRP mechanism, install
      ports/security/cyrus-sasl2-srp.
      If you want to use LDAP auxprop plugin, install
      ports/security/cyrus-sasl2-ldapdb.

Message from gamin-0.1.10_10:

--
Gamin will only provide realtime notification of changes for at most n files,
where n is the minimum value between (kern.maxfiles * 0.7) and
(kern.maxfilesperproc - 200). Beyond that limit, files will be polled.

If you often open several large folders with Nautilus, you might want to
increase the kern.maxfiles tunable (you do not need to set
kern.maxfilesperproc, since it is computed at boot time from kern.maxfiles).

The behavior of gamin can be controlled via the various gaminrc files.
See http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/config.html on how to create
these files.  In particular, if you find gam_server is taking up too much
CPU time polling for changes, something like the following may help
in one of the gaminrc files:

# reduce polling frequency to once per 10 seconds
# for UFS file systems in order to lower CPU load
fsset ufs poll 10

You might want to consider increasing the kern.maxfiles tunable if you plan
to use this library for applications that need to monitor activity of a lot
of files.

Message from libexo-4.18.0_4:

--
If you are upgrading your packages, due to a problem with the pkg
package management tool libexo requires to be upgraded by itself
before the rest of packages, to ensure correct installation, as
described in UPDATING entry 20210102.

If you skipped the manual step and XFCE parts are failing due to
missing libraries, please run "pkg upgrade -f libexo" to force
reinstalling the missing parts.

Message from lsof-4.99.3_2,8:

--
NOTE: Due to the way the FreeBSD build clusters make packages,
you may see a warning similar to the following:

lsof: WARNING: compiled for FreeBSD release 11.1-RELEASE-p6; this is 11.1-RELEASE-p4.

This is because the poudriere jails that build the packages don't have the
corresponding kernel installed, so they don't know that the kernel version is different.

This warning can be ignored if you are using a system that is updated via freebsd-update
and are using pre-built packages.

How to start: http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba4/HOWTO

* Your configuration is: /usr/local/etc/smb4.conf

* All the relevant databases are under: /var/db/samba4

* All the logs are under: /var/log/samba4

* Provisioning script is: /usr/local/bin/samba-tool

For the working DNS updates you will need to either build dns/bind9*
with the enabled GSSAPI(GSSAPI_MIT5 is recommended) or install
dns/samba-nsupdate package, which is preconfigured with such a support.

You will need to specify location of the 'nsupdate' command in the
smb4.conf file:

    nsupdate command = /usr/local/bin/samba-nsupdate -g

For additional documentation check: https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/User_Documentation

Port related bug reports can go to the https://gitlab.com/samba-freebsd/ports/-/issues or
to the FreeBSD Bugzilla https://bugs.freebsd.org/

All Samba related bug reports should go to the: https://bugzilla.samba.org/

Message from xfce4-tumbler-4.18.2_2:

--
To override the default configuration, you must copy the rc-file:

	mkdir ~/.config/tumbler
	cp /usr/local/etc/xdg/tumbler/tumbler.rc ~/.config/tumbler

The COVER plugin requires manual configuration.

Tumbler supports external plugins to be able to generate thumbnails for
more file formats.

Plugins are configured through ".thumbnailer" files in
/usr/local/share/thumbnailers or (for users) ~/.local/share/thumbnailers.

Ports for libraries and programs sometimes provide such configuration
files and binaries to support thumbnails for their formats (for example
graphics/libheif).

For more information see https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/tumbler/start and
https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/tumbler/available_plugins
=====
Message from xfce4-session-4.18.4:

--
To be able to shutdown or reboot your system, you'll have to add .rules
files in /usr/local/etc/polkit-1/rules.d directory. Which looks
like this (replace PUTYOURGROUPHERE by your group):

polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if ((action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart" ||
      action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop")
      && subject.isInGroup("PUTYOURGROUPHERE")) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});

For those who have working suspend/resume:

polkit.addRule(function (action, subject) {
  if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.suspend"
      && subject.isInGroup("PUTYOURGROUPHERE")) {
    return polkit.Result.YES;
  }
});


This port installs a startup file for xscreensaver but it is
disabled by default. This is so because the XFCE metaport
installs xfce4-screensaver to autostart and having both enabled
causes conflicts.

If you want to change the screen saver being used and enable
xscreensaver please go to the Session and Startup settings, and in
the Application Autostart tab enable only the relevant screensaver:

Screensaver -> to enable xscreensaver
XFCE Screensaver -> to enable xfce4-screensaver
