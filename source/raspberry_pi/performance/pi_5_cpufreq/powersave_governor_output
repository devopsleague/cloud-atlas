analyzing CPU 1:
  driver: cpufreq-dt
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0 1 2 3
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0 1 2 3
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 1.50 GHz - 2.40 GHz
  available frequency steps:  1.50 GHz, 1.60 GHz, 1.70 GHz, 1.80 GHz, 1.90 GHz, 2.00 GHz, 2.10 GHz, 2.20 GHz, 2.30 GHz, 2.40 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil
  current policy: frequency should be within 1.50 GHz and 2.40 GHz.
                  The governor "powersave" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: 1.50 GHz (asserted by call to hardware)
